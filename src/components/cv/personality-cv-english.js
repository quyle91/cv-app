                <p>Introvert personality</p>
                <p>Slow to absorb but long to remember. Prefer to find out clearly if possible.</p>
                <p>Love watching American movies and American pragmatic culture, love talking about results and methods to get them. I can't listen to meaningless compliments and criticisms.</p>
